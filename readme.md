# Python Lectures

In this series of lectures, you will learn the basics of programming in Python. So-called Jupyter Notebooks, recognizable by the file extension .ipynb, are used for this purpose. The upper section of each notebook contains a part for executing and exploring various functionalities with explanations, while the lower section contains a series of exercises that you should be able to complete with the skills you have learned. However, you do not have to solve every exercise in order to advance to the next lecture. The exercises are color coded into:

- ${\color{green}\text{Easy}}$ You should be able to solve these based on the content of the corresponding lecture alone.
- ${\color{orange}\text{Medium}}$ These should also be possible to solve based on the content but requires you to actually understand what you are doing instead of just copying it.
- ${\color{red}\text{Hard}}$ These exercises usually require some additional knowledge in the form of internet searches or AI assistants (e.g. ChatGPT). Make sure you try to understand the proposed solutions you may find.
